## 🌟 My Journey

I started with a strong theoretical foundation in preparatory classes, where I mastered the fundamentals of programming with C, Python, and discovered my love for OCaml. Upon entering engineering school, I've expanded my horizons by self-learning modern web development technologies.

I joined my school's Junior Enterprise as a Vice Responsible for the Systems Information team, where I lead server deployment initiatives and contribute to internal technology infrastructure. I plan to continue my engineering studies by specializing in the Numeric major, where I can further develop my technical expertise.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [Metamorpion](https://github.com/3lW30N/metamorpion)
**Ultimate Tic Tac Toe AI Solver**

At the conclusion of my preparatory classes, I developed an AI-powered program to solve the Ultimate Tic Tac Toe game (also known as Metamorpion). This project combines classical game theory with modern AI techniques to create an intelligent opponent that can strategize and adapt during gameplay.

- **Technologies used**: Python, AI algorithms
- **Key features**: Strategic depth analysis, optimal move calculation, interactive gameplay
- **Achievements**: Successfully implemented multiple AI models to solve this complex game variant

### [EPF Chatbot](https://github.com/epf-org/chatbot)
**Intelligent Conversational Assistant**

Founded and led the development of a sophisticated chatbot project under the EPF organization I created. This ongoing project aims to enhance user interactions through natural language processing and contextual understanding.

- **Technologies used**: TypeScript, Express.js, NLP libraries
- **Key features**: Contextual responses, multi-domain knowledge base, integration capabilities
- **Status**: Active development (2025)

### Junior Enterprise Web Development
**Internal Business Applications**

I contribute to developing and maintaining internal websites for a junior enterprise, helping to create professional tools that enhance organizational efficiency and service delivery.

- **Technologies used**: JavaScript, React, Express, Database systems
- **Key features**: User management, project tracking, client portal interfaces
- **Impact**: Streamlined internal processes and improved client interaction channels
